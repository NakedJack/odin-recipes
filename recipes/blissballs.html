<h3>Bliss balls are easy to make and can be easily modified. The ones I like best aren't the healthiest. My recipe is as follows:</h5>
<ul><li>Dates</li>
    <li>Peanut Butter</li>
    <li>Dessicated Coconut</li>
    <li>Cacao</li>
    <li>Almonds</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Setup food proccesor</li>
    <li>Add ingrediants one by one to food proccessor, blending between (any order)</li>
    <li>Once all ingrdiants are added, sample mixture</li>
    <li>Add more ingrediants as nessasary to match your tastes</li>
    <li>Roll mixture into balls (about the size of a golfball)</li>
    <li>At this stage you can eat them but it is best ti refridgerate them to help them maintain there form</li>
</ol>
